# Commitmas 2015
Trying this out for 2015, it's is all [Scott's](https://github.com/sboss/) fault...

## What I learned
###Day 1
- I don't think my time playing Destiny and working on the Kings Fall raid count towards learning anything...

###Day 2
- I didn't know about the Windows package installer, [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/)
  - Looks to be fairly straight forward to install git and other packages (see below)
  - Gotta take the time to add the git/bin path to my PATH env in windows

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) was something I hadn't seen before either
  - Looks like it's built off/like Atom/Brackets

- Learned some markdown as well...
  - Installed a couple markdown plugins in Atom. The preview pane is nice.
    - Markdown Preview Plus, Ctrl-Shift-M to see the preview.
    - It seems that one of the markdown plugins I installed also cleans up the formatting and adds some things when I save the file. Neat

  - [Github's Markdown Basics](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/) link is a handy reference too.

- Read over the [Git Commit Message Format](https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap/wiki/Git-Commit-Message-Format) link.
  - I know I'm far from perfect here...
  - Never thought about doing longer commit messages in vim

###Day 3
- Got messing around with [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/quickstart/) to setup my github page (see beow)
  - I like it for the most part, seems to be a simple enough blog engine
  - Had to dig in to sass a bit to adjust the template
  - they are drawing the icons directly for the social media sites in svg, looks weird in code

- Learned a little more about [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax); syntax and what not.

## What I did
### Day 1
- Missed doing anything here cause of Taco Tuesday and Destiny reset activities

### Day 2

- [x] Took part in the Commitmas webinar tonight
  - [Tweeted](https://twitter.com/Woody2143/status/672223321975627777) about PuTTy Agent
  - And a follow-up [tweet](https://twitter.com/Woody2143/status/672226386577375234) after my tweet was mentioned on the webinar

- [x] Read up on markdown
- [x] Watched the Day 1 webinar.
- [ ] find a repo to fork and work on...

### Day 3
- [x] Decided to create a github page; [woody2143.github.io](http://woody2143.github.io/)
  - This took a bit of time to tweak, but so far I like it well enough.

- [ ] find a repo to fork and work on...
