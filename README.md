# Commitmas 2015
Trying this out for 2015, it's is all Scott's fault...

## What I learned
###Day 1
- Missed doing anything here cause of Taco Tuesday and Destiny

###Day 2
- I didn't know about the Windows package installer, Chocolatey
  - [https://chocolatey.org/](https://chocolatey.org/)
  - Looks to be fairly straight forward to install git and other packages (see below)
  - Gotta take the time to add the git/bin path to my PATH env in windows

- Visual Studio Code was something I hadn't seen before either
  - [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  - Looks like it's built off/like Atom/Brackets

- Installed a couple markdown plugins in Atom. The preview pane is nice.
  - Markdown Preview Plus
  - It seems that one of the markdown plugins I installed also cleans up the formatting and adds some things when I save the file. Neat
