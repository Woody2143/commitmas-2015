# Commitmas 2015
Trying this out for 2015, it's is all [Scott's](@sboss) fault...

## What I learned
###Day 1
- I don't think my time playing Destiny and working on the Kings Fall raid count towards learning anything...

###Day 2
- I didn't know about the Windows package installer, [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/)
  - Looks to be fairly straight forward to install git and other packages (see below)
  - Gotta take the time to add the git/bin path to my PATH env in windows

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) was something I hadn't seen before either
  - Looks like it's built off/like Atom/Brackets

- Learned some markdown as well...
  - Installed a couple markdown plugins in Atom. The preview pane is nice.
    - Markdown Preview Plus, Ctrl-Shift-M to see the preview.
    - It seems that one of the markdown plugins I installed also cleans up the formatting and adds some things when I save the file. Neat

  - [Github's Markdown Basics](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/) link is a handy reference too.

- Read over the [Git Commit Message Format](https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap/wiki/Git-Commit-Message-Format) link.
  - I know I'm far from perfect here...
  - Never thought about doing longer commit messages in vim

## What I did
